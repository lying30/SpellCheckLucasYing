| September 23 | 12:40-1:40pm  |  I thought through some ideas for how to make this solution, then tried to implement a linear version of the code to start and then will improve that version later on with possibly binary search? |
| September 24 |   9:30-10pm   |                                    Just finished up creating my linear search version for a basic understanding of how to make a bad solution so now I can continue thinking of ways to improve it. |
| September 25 | 10:50-11:30am | Worked through trying to implement binary search into my solution, but did not complete it at the moment. Will try to implement later for homework so I have a faster version of a solution for V1. |
