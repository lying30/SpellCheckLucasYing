| September 23 | 12:40-1:40pm | I thought through some ideas for how to make this solution, then tried to implement a linear version of the code to start and then will improve that version later on with possibly binary search? |
| September 24 |  9:30-10pm   |                                   Just finished up creating my linear search version for a basic understanding of how to make a bad solution so now I can continue thinking of ways to improve it. |
