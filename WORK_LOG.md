Will try to implement later for homework so I have a faster version of a solution for V1. |
| September 26 |      7-8      | I implemented a binary search into my code which allows me to pass through all the checks except for rome. I think the rome check bc it is super long my code needs to be more efficient to get through it all within the time window to pass the spell check. I will continue working towards a faster algorithm but I believe this is a good start for the first attempt. |
