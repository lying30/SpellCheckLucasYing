| September 23 |  12:40-1:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                          I thought through some ideas for how to make this solution, then tried to implement a linear version of the code to start and then will improve that version later on with possibly binary search? |
| September 24 |   9:30-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                            Just finished up creating my linear search version for a basic understanding of how to make a bad solution so now I can continue thinking of ways to improve it. |
| September 25 | 10:50-11:30am  |                                                                                                                                                                         Worked through trying to implement binary search into my solution, but did not complete it at the moment. Will try to implement later for homework so I have a faster version of a solution for V1. |
| September 26 |     7-8PM      | I implemented a binary search into my code which allows me to pass through all the checks except for rome. I think the rome check bc it is super long my code needs to be more efficient to get through it all within the time window to pass the spell check. I will continue working towards a faster algorithm but I believe this is a good start for the first attempt. |

| October 6    | 12:30pm-3:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I continued working on implementing a trie into my solution. Messed with converting letters to lowercase and finishing up the insert and search methods. |
| October 6    |  7:30-8:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                     Realized I forgot the trie for the misspelled words and I hadn't added it yet. Added it and continued trying to make my trie solution correct for the rome, bard, and alice test cases. |
