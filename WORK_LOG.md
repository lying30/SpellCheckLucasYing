Will try to implement later for homework so I have a faster version of a solution for V1. |

I think the rome check bc it is super long my code needs to be more efficient to get through it all within the time window to pass the spell check. I will continue working towards a faster algorithm but I believe this is a good start for the first attempt. |

Messed with converting letters to lowercase and finishing up the insert and search methods. |

Added it and continued trying to make my trie solution correct for the rome, bard, and alice test cases. |
| October 6    |  9pm- 11:30pm  | Sorry I forgot to commit more throughout this work session I was locked in. First I was trying to figure out how to fix my trie solution because for some reason it is not detecting certain words as misspelled even though they are. For example, in Alice, it is missing one misspelled word "o√π" and I think it is because of the accent. I tried a lot of different things like changing size of the arrays for each child node and also trying to clean the word. I couldn't figure this part out so far, so then I went to try TST solution for a change of thought. It was actually not that bad to implement TST and only took me about 1.5 hours. And, best of all it actually fully works for the TST solution. Although right now my Trie solution still has some errors, so I will work on debugging those errors. Also, I have to write comments so I will do that right now as well. |
